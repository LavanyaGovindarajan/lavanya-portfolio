    "bio":"I am a master's student in Data Science with academic experience in Python, R, predictive modeling, and visualizations. I am passionate about leveraging data analysis and machine learning to drive impactful business decisions. As a software professional with 6.5 years of experience in application development within the telecommunications domain, I spearheaded the design and implementation of critical microservices for a cloud-native SaaS platform, optimizing data processes. I love taking initiatives at work, be it supporting women in tech through my role in the Corporate Responsibility Society or founding an international club to help new students navigate cultural differences. My commitment to fostering community and inclusivity drives me to create spaces where diverse voices can be heard.",
